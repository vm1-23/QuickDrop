## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  

1. **Upload:**  
   - The user uploads a file via the web interface.

2. **Generate Link:**  
   - A unique download link is generated.  
   - The link is shown to the user for sharing.  

3. **Expiration:**  
   - The backend periodically checks for expired files and removes them from storage.  

4. **Download:**  
   - The download route validates the file‚Äôs expiration and download status.  
   - For one-time downloads, the file is deleted immediately after it‚Äôs accessed once.  

5. **Progress Bar:**  
   - Real-time progress updates during upload using client-side event tracking.
